Description: This program first takes a line of input then splits and stores the seperate words in a list. The program then checks
the first two elements of the list to find out what action to take.
If it is INSERT KEY then the username and the key inserted will be stored.
If it is TURN KEY the inserted key will be checked against the authorized keys and if there is a match and the key turner is the same
as the key inserter then the door will be unlocked.
If it is ENTER HOUSE, the enterer is the same as the inserter and the turner, and the door is unlocked the enterer will be added to a
list of people inside the house and the door will be relocked.
If it is WHO'S INSIDE the program will print out the list of people inside the house or NOBODY HOME if the list is empty.
If it is LEAVE HOUSE the program will remove the person from the list or print <username> NOT HERE if they are not inside the house.
If it is CHANGE LOCKS, the lock changer is the owner, and the owner is inside the house the list of authorized keys will be changed to
the new keys.
Any other input will print out ERROR.
